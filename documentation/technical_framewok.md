# Echo Chamber - Technical Design Document

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Application Type
- **Desktop Application** with local-first architecture
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Single-user focused (with potential for future cloud sync)

## 2. Technology Stack Evaluation

### 2.1 Frontend Framework
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Electron + React** | Cross-platform, large ecosystem, good PDF support | Larger app size | ✅ Recommended |
| Tauri + React | Smaller bundle size, better performance | Less mature, smaller community | Consider for future optimization |
| Native (e.g., .NET MAUI) | Best performance | Platform-specific development | Not recommended for MVP |

### 2.2 PDF Processing
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **PDF.js** | Open-source, well-maintained, good for viewing | Limited editing capabilities | ✅ Recommended for MVP |
| PDFKit | Good for PDF generation | Complex for editing | Consider for export features |
| PSPDFKit | Full-featured | Expensive, overkill for MVP | Re-evaluate post-MVP |

### 2.3 Local Database
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **SQLite** | Serverless, ACID compliant, good tooling | Limited concurrent writes (not an issue for single user) | ✅ Recommended |
| IndexedDB | Built into browsers | Less structured, harder to query | Not recommended |
| PouchDB | Sync capabilities | Overhead not needed for MVP | Consider if adding sync later |

### 2.4 State Management
| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|----------------|
| **Zustand** | Simple, minimal boilerplate | Less opinionated | ✅ Recommended |
| Redux | Predictable state management | More boilerplate | Overkill for MVP |
| Context API | Built into React | Performance concerns with frequent updates | Use for theme/global state |

## 3. Recommended Tech Stack

## 4. Key Technical Decisions

### 4.1 Local-First Architecture
- **Rationale**: Better offline support and faster performance
- **Implementation**: SQLite for data storage, file system for documents
- **Future Consideration**: Add cloud sync as an optional feature

### 4.2 PDF Handling
- **Viewing**: PDF.js for rendering PDFs
- **Editing**: Basic text editing with PDF.js, with custom drawing layer
- **Performance**: Virtualized rendering for large documents

### 4.3 Data Management
- **Database**: SQLite with TypeORM for type safety
- **File Storage**: Store PDFs and images in user's app data directory
- **Backups**: Automatic backup system for user data

## 5. Development Workflow

### 5.1 Setup
1. Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
2. Git for version control
3. VS Code (recommended) with recommended extensions

### 5.2 Development Scripts
- `dev`: Start development server
- `build`: Create production build
- `test`: Run tests
- `package`: Package application for distribution

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting
- Add web workers for heavy computations
- Optimize PDF rendering

### 6.2 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Component tests for UI
- End-to-end tests for critical flows

### 6.3 Deployment
- Auto-update mechanism
- Code signing for production builds
- Installer generation for each platform

## 7. Open Questions

1. Should we implement a plugin system for future extensibility?
2. What are the specific PDF editing requirements beyond basic text and drawing?
3. Are there any specific accessibility requirements to consider?
