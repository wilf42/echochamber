# Solo RPG Companion Application - Coding Practices Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding practices to be followed during the development of the Solo RPG Companion Application.  Given that this project will be undertaken by a single developer, the practices are designed for efficient, focused development.

## Agile Development Approach – Streamlined

*   **Iterative Development:** We will focus on delivering small, functional increments of the application based on the user stories.
*   **Self-Organization:**  As a lone developer, I will be responsible for all aspects of the project – planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment.
*   **Focused Sprint Cycles (Personal):** I will establish my own sprint cycles (e.g., 1-2 weeks) to achieve specific goals. These cycles will be governed by the user stories and the overall project vision.

## Coding Principles

1.  **Test-Driven Design (TDD):**
    *   **Red-Green-Refactor:**  For every user story, I will follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

2.  **Code Quality & Maintainability:**
    *   **Simplicity:**  Prioritize writing clear, concise, and easily understandable code.
    *   **Readability:** Use meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and comments where necessary.

3.  **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):**
    *   **Code Reuse:**  Identify and abstract common functionality into reusable components or methods.
    *   **Avoid Duplication:**  Never write the same code twice.  If code is duplicated, refactor it into a reusable component.

4.  **SOLID Principles (Where Applicable):**
    *   While a full adherence to the SOLID principles will be the goal, I will focus on the key aspects relevant to my application, such as Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Liskov Substitution.

5.  **Version Control:**
    *   **Git:** I will use Git for version control.

##  Knowledge Management & Reflection

*   **Personal Notes:** I will diligently maintain personal notes documenting decisions, challenges, and learnings throughout the development process.
*   **Regular Reflection:** I will schedule regular time (e.g., weekly) for reflection, reviewing my progress, and identifying areas for improvement. This will help me avoid re-inventing the wheel.

##  AI Support – Utilizing AI Tools

*   I will leverage AI tools (like this one!) to assist with code generation, debugging, and documentation, but always critically evaluating the output.
